DanGenLife Ecosystem Evolution Simulation
DanGenLife is an educational project at the intersection of Biology and Computer Science
The primary goal of this simulation is to explore ecological correlations and evolutionary "arms races" through the lens of software engineering

Learning Objectives

Object-Oriented Programming: Implementing classes for different biological entities (Plankton, Herbivore, Predato, Apex Predator) 

Data Management: Using lists and parameters to track population growth and energy transfer.

Algorithmic Logic: Applying conditional operators and loops to simulate hunting, reproduction, and survival.

Refactoring: Improving code structure for better readability and Case-Sensitivity consistency .







How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies: pip install matplotlib numpy psutil.

Run the simulation: python Main.py.
